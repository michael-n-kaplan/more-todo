Just Shiradi Wiz -- would be nice to have energy burst
                 -- passable without heroic TRs or any other twists
Monkcher -- fully geared, PLs very nice, +5 tomes, etc etc etc
        -- Because of tomes, should probably be a TR life 
Healer -- FvS / Cleric / Druid -- Basically have this now, but on a toon that
          was planning more TRs
CC'er -- Wiz or Bard, maybe both -- should be ok first life w/o great tomes
          -- more lives help with DCs, party oriented char
     -- perhaps 2 chars, one wiz, one bard
Blaster -- Sorc mainly, druid possibly, more lives help with DCs, and epic
               PLs for crit chance ala Farwind sorc build
TR Runner -- multiple epic PLs help a lot for this, as well as greensteel and
                      other gear
Crafter -- doesn't need much of anything
THF Melee
  possibly a Second THF Stick build
TWF Melee
Juggy Style -- twf jugg?  twf variant needs better tomes
Tank build - party oriented, even though suboptimal in current meta, should be a boon
        in somewhat weakers groups
        -- probably paly, monk, ftr pajama wearer, or sword and board w/light armor
           to keep evasion and dodge
        -- Maybe Wiz (wraith, EK), monk (eva), pal/ftr (stance) instead?
          -- pal gives saves, ftr gives feats, both nice
